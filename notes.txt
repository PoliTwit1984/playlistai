c. Fetch User's Spotify Data:

Calls get_user_top_tracks(sp, limit=50)
Calls get_user_recently_played(sp, limit=50)
Calls get_user_saved_tracks(sp, limit=50)

d. Get Recommendations:

Calls select_seed_tracks() with top_tracks, recent_tracks, saved_tracks
Calls get_spotify_recommendations() with seed_tracks and genre_preferences - is this going to get us enough tracks for a high discoverabbility score (you didn't mentionthat in summary)
We need to change duration to minutes instead of num tracks
